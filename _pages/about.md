 I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, advised by Prof. Jimeng Sun. My broad research interests include: 
 - Generative modeling in AI
 - Cheminformatics and Computational Drug Discovery
 - Deep Learning on Healthcare
 - Graph Neural Neworks
 - Information Extraction

I received his Bachelor's in Computer Science and Master's in Computational Natural Sciences from IIIT Hyderabad, India, where I worked with Prof. U. Deva Priyakumar. Previously, I worked as a Software Developer at Microsoft India and as a Machine Learning Engineer at AIcrowd. I am always eager to chat about research concerning Deep Learning and Physical Sciences.
